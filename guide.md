# Training Guidelines & Tips


### General Guidelines
* Start with the largest muscle group first then work progressively to the smaller muscles groups. For instance, do your flat bench, then inclines, then shoulders, then triceps

* Deload week: Incorporate a deload week every 6-8 weeks of training to provide for ample rest to the body

### Push-Pull Method
On push days, you want to focus on all the muscles used to push, i.e. chest, shoulders and triceps. On pull days, you concentrate on your back and biceps. 

Say you decide to mix things up a bit and on day 1 you do your chest and biceps. On day 2, you decide to do your back and triceps. On day 2, you will not have a good back workout because your biceps will be fatigued from the workout the day before and you will not be able to work your back to its fullest potential because your biceps will give out before your back does.  
If you mix it up, you'll never have fully recovered to give your particular muscle group a good, thorough workout. 

Also, you may not see as much growth if you mix it up because you will never give your muscles a true day off. 
If you train your chest on one day, and your triceps on another, on your chest day you will automatically work your triceps which will not get the necessary rest since you'll be doing triceps on another day, which will automatically work your chest a bit, not giving it the rest required to grow.

PS: Some people like to pair shoulders with legs because training chest, triceps and shoulders on the same day with heavy weights can be quite taxing. 


### How to Inhale
During a rep, inhale when it is easy and exhale when it's hard. For example, during a bench press, inhale when coming down and exhale when lifting up

### Types of Sets
A set is a specific number of reps performed in a row with a rest period at the end. 
There are multiple possible types of sets, some common ones are:

#### Straight Set
This is a number of reps performed in a set followed by a rest period, then repeated for one or more sets. Once all sets of an exercise are complete, you move on to the next exercise.

#### Superset
Pair two exercises together and perform a set of each back-to-back with no rest in between. You rest after youâ€™ve completed a set of both exercises, then repeat the superset for the desired number of sets. These are typically done using opposing muscles groups such as chest and back, but also popular are complementary multi-joint/single-joint pairs such as a chest and triceps combination. They allow you to perform more work in less time and are great for higher intensity, shorter duration workouts.

#### Circuit
A circuit is a series of exercises performed in a row or one continue long set without rest. Exercises in a circuits can be performed either for time or reps, usually with light weight or just bodyweight. They are mainly used for weight loss, endurance or more cardio-focused goals.

#### Pyramid
In this, you manipulate both the number of reps and the amount of weight lifted per set. For a typical pyramid, you start with lighter weight for more reps and with each subsequent set, you increase the weight and reduce the number of reps performed. Pyramids are generally used for hypertrophy and strength. 

One variation of this is when you don't reduce the number of reps and keep increasing the weight with every set.

#### Dropset
A drop set is where you perform as many reps of an exercise at a particular weight as you can, then quickly reduce to a lighter weight and continue again to fatigue at this new weight, then quickly move to an even lighter weight and so on until exhaustion. Drop sets as usually done with three or four rounds of progressively lighter weights. Also called Burnouts, they are a very advanced technique, specifically used for hypertrophy.
