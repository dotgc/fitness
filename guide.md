# Training Guidelines & Tips


### General guidelines
* Start with the largest muscle group first then work progressively to the smaller muscles groups. For instance, do your flat bench, then inclines, then shoulders, then triceps

* Deload week: Incorporate a deload week every 6-8 weeks of training to provide for ample rest to the body

### Push-Pull method
On push days, you want to focus on all the muscles used to push, i.e. chest, shoulders and triceps. On pull days, you concentrate on your back and biceps. 

Say you decide to mix things up a bit and on day 1 you do your chest and biceps. On day 2, you decide to do your back and triceps. On day 2, you will not have a good back workout because your biceps will be fatigued from the workout the day before and you will not be able to work your back to its fullest potential because your biceps will give out before your back does.  
If you mix it up, you'll never have fully recovered to give your particular muscle group a good, thorough workout. 

Also, you may not see as much growth if you mix it up because you will never give your muscles a true day off. 
If you train your chest on one day, and your triceps on another, on your chest day you will automatically work your triceps which will not get the necessary rest since you'll be doing triceps on another day, which will automatically work your chest a bit, not giving it the rest required to grow.

PS: Some people like to pair shoulders with legs because training chest, triceps and shoulders on the same day with heavy weights can be quite taxing. 

### Questions?
1. Shoulder position to activate lats
2. reverse pec deck for back deltoid development
3. side lateral for medial deltoid
4. shoulder press for overall shoulders


### How to inhale:
During a rep, inhale when it is easy and exhale when it's hard. For example, during a bench press, inhale when coming down and exhale when lifting up


### Pushups
Inhale and exhale with every rep. Inhale when coming down and exhale while moving up continuously
