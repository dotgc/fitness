### Building base
* For building base, 4x/week running is going to do wonders since such a schedule allows time for ample rest as well


### 1 2 3 Rule for Training
* 1 - soft run: easy pace run for some distance
* 2 - hard run: 2 times your soft run distance 
* 3 - long run: 3 times your soft run distance 


### One possible weekly plan
* 0 2 0 1 2 0 3 
* i.e. if your soft run is 2 miles, then the schedule would be (in miles): 0 4 0 2 4 6
