# Form Guide

### Deadlift form
1. Barbell should be right over the middle of the feet
2. Feet shoulder width apart and slightly angled outward
3. Don’t go down too much, it’s not a squat
4. Engage the glutes and squeeze glutes at the top of the motion
5. Shoulders down and back, chest up
6. The bar should be grazing the knees while going up; that’s normal
7. Engage the lats by pretending you are squeezing your arms in the armpit
8. Spine should also be in neutral position- no looking into the mirror, straight with the spine
9. DO NOT stretch knees first and then hinge across the hips, both are to be done in one swift motion
10. Load the hamstrings and then in one swift motion, go to the top
11. At the top of the motion, squeeze the butt cheeks as much as you can. It’s not the same as leaning back
12. Engage the lats by thinking of bending the bar
13. The pelvis should be tilted forward
	

### Squats form
1. Go as deep as possible, the hip hinge should ideally go below knee joints
2. Feet shoulder width apart and angled slightly outward
3. Feet should be right below the barbell
4. Take a deep breath in at the top position and hold your breath thereby tightening your core for the entire go-down, move-up motion. Release breath again at the top and take another deep breath and continue. 
5. You are supposed to hold the breath for the entire movement
6. Use abdominal belt and knee sleeves
7. Barbell position:
    1. high position - still below the neck
    2. low position - on the traps touching rear deltoids
8. While going up, don’t just think about pushing up, rather think about driving your hips forward, pushing your heels against the surface and squeezing the glutes
9. Follow the same path on the knees while going down and up with knees going slightly outwards, parallel to the direction of the heels
10. Keep the back spine straight. no flexion


### Bent over barbell row
1. Back straight and parallel to the ground
2. Pull in with the elbows ending at the chest
3. The bend of the torso is responsible for the lats, if you stand relatively straighter, you'll exercise more of the upper back than the lats
4. If you pull to your belly button, you'll target more of the lats. If you pull to your chest, you'll target more of your upper back, rear deltoids etc.


### Pull-Up Form:
1. Think of "squeezing" the elbows to the body. 
2. Think as if you are bending the bar  - this will help engage the lats
3. Neck position should be as if making a double chin
4. Keep the scapula engaged even at the bottom position. Don’t dead hang
5. Legs should be straight


### Lat Pull Down Form
1. Keep your chest tall/bring your chest to the bar
2. Keep your elbows pointed straight down
3. Squeeze your lats/think of pulling from your armpits. It's a lat exercise. You gotta tighten the lats
4. Lower to your chin or just below
5. Grab just outside your shoulders or a little wider
6. Also try using the ‘V-grip’ handle
7. Not being straight and bending will exercise the shoulders more than the traps


### Shoulder Press Form
1. Elbows should be ahead of the body
2. Done preferably while standing, but can also do it sitting on the bench by raising it upright at a slight angle
3. Shoulder blades should squeeze




### Pushups
1. Inhale and exhale with every rep. Inhale when coming down and exhale while moving up continuously
